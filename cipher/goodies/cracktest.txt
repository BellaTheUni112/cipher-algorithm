this was made using the original cipher.py and the cipherbruteforce.py



Input : this is a super secret message i have ciphered, so if you're seeing this, fuck you. but i guess congrats on cracking this. i need to make this message long to give it a chance of being cracked but yeah. also, epstein didn't kill himself, just saying. but yeah i hope you like this cipher algorithm, anyway, bye.

Cracked text interpretation: this is a stupid secret message i have encrypted, so if you’re seeing this, fuck you. but i guess congrats on cracking this. i need to make this message long to give us a chance of being cracked but yeah. also, epstein didn’t kill himself, must remain. but yeah i hope you like this cipher (algorithm), anyway, bye.
